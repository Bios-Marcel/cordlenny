# Cordlenny

This shows a very simple example for extending
[Cordless](https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/cordless) via JavaScript.

Simply dump the script into the subfolder `scripts` of your cordless configuration
folder and launch cordless. The script should automatically load on startup and
be applied every time you send a message.

Sending this message:

```
Hello ;lenny; World
```

would result in this message:

```
Hello ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) World
```

actually being sent.
